# GeistTools

GeistTools is a collection of a modding API, and my personal mods for the game Atlyss.

Development of this repo is still very much in progress, and there's not that much information here yet, nor a mature API library.

## GeistTools.API

A modding API and utility for interacting with various parts of Atlyss.

See more info at its [README.md](https://github.com/Alyren/GeistTools/tree/main/GeistTools.API/README.md)

## GeistTools.Tweaks

A collection of quality-of-life tweaks and bugfixes for the game.

See more info at its [README.md](https://github.com/Alyren/GeistTools/tree/main/GeistTools.Tweaks/README.md)
